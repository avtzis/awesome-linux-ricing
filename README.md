## Description

This very **AWESOME** list is made to help anyone interested in extensively customizing their Linux desktop, or what we call 'ricing'. It's a very good place to start your adventure, helping you discover what you can use, or what **ELSE** you can use to over-customize your rice. The goal is to have some of the very popular themes and tools, as well as some lesser-known ones, to help you find that perfect fit. It's your go-to list when you need to waste your time ricing, instead of tendign to your responsibilities.

## Window Manager
<details>
  <summary><b>Window Manager (WM) vs Desktop Environment (DE)</b></summary>
  <p>A <b>WM</b> is a software that manages the windows on your screen. It controls the placement and appearance of windows, and provides basic functionality like window resizing and moving.</p>
  <p>A <b>DE</b> is a collection of software that provides a complete desktop experience. It includes the <b>window manager</b>, along with a file manager, a bar/panel, and other apps, tools and utilities.</p>
  <p><b>DEs</b> usually provide a more integrated and user-friendly experience, while <b>WMs</b> are more lightweight and customizable, requiring you to manually configure and install additional software to get the same functionality as a <b>DE</b>, but with more control over the look and feel of your desktop.</p>
</details>
<br/>
<details>
  <summary><b>Stacking vs Tiling vs Dynamic WMs</b></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Stacking WMs</b> are traditional window managers that place windows on top of each other (like MS Windows). They allow you to move and resize windows freely, but they can be cluttered and hard to manage with many windows open.</li>
    <li><b>Tiling WMs</b> automatically arrange windows in a non-overlapping layout. They are efficient and help you make the most of your screen space, but they can be less flexible than stacking WMs.</li>
    <li><b>Dynamic WMs</b> combine the best of both worlds. They allow you to switch between tiling and stacking layouts, giving you the flexibility to choose the best layout for your workflow.</li>
  </ul>
</details>
<br/>
<details>
  <summary><b>X11 vs Wayland</b></summary>
  <p><b>X11</b> is the traditional display server protocol used in Linux. It is mature and stable, but it has some limitations in terms of security and performance.</p>
  <p><b>Wayland</b> is a newer display server protocol that aims to address the limitations of <b>X11</b>. It is more secure and efficient, allowing for better performance, smoother animations, touch gestures, etc. However, it is still under development, and usually Nvidia GPUs have issues with it.</p>
  <p>All applications with a GUI (as well as WMs) are run under a display server and are usually developed for a specific display server protocol, meaning you can't run a <b>Wayland</b> app on <b>X11</b>, or vice versa. However, it is possible to use a compatibility layer like XWayland to run <b>X11</b> apps on <b>Wayland</b>.</p>
</details>

    <li><b>Serif</b> fonts have decorative lines or strokes at the ends of the letters. They are often used for body text in printed materials.</li>
    <li><b>Sans-serif</b> fonts are modern and clean, without the decorative flourishes of serif fonts. They are often used for headings and titles.</li>
    <li><b>Monospace</b> fonts have equal spacing between characters, making them ideal for coding, editors and terminals.</li>
  </ul>
    <p><b>Sans</b> and <b>Mono</b> are the ones usually used for ricing, as they are more readable and modern.</p>
</details>
<br/>

<details>
  <summary><b>What are ligatures</b></summary>
  <p><b>Ligatures</b> are special characters that combine two or more letters into a single glyph. They are used to improve the appearance and readability of text, especially in code and terminal applications.</p>

## Installation and Configuration
Quick note for beginners:
  - Most of these apps are linked to repositories on GitHub, where you can find installation instructions. However, typically, you can install apps using your package manager way more easily. We usually don't use a "download" button on Linux when installing an app, so it's best to avoid it if you come across one.
  - Configuring on Linux is usually done by editing text files. These files should be in `~/.config/` and can follow a specific syntax. To be sure, check the documentation of the app.
